# Rescale and Resize images


### Why we need to rescale and resize images when handling images and videos in OpenCV?

* help downsize the pixel of an image
* reduce time to train model since there are less pixels in the transformed images


### There is some time we need to use original images resolution
* To preseve the detail that are sometimes crucial for recognition
